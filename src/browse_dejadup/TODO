# TODO list 

## Small things
* Try using a dict instead of a tree and see what the data-usage is then
(separate branch)

## Large new features

### Interaction
* Add a simple cli with fake `cd` `ls` and `ls -a` commands
* Create ncurses type browser
* Create a simple gui resembling a normal file-manager

### Performance
* Use a different datatype to make more valuable use of the space
(Cython or C bridge perhaps?)

### Function
* Be able to send a duplicity command that retrieves a particular file
